# Hotel-booking-classify
 
This project aims at predict customers cancelling reservations at Portugal. The data set used in this challenge consists of 40,000 reservations from resort hotels and 80,000 reservations from city hotels. The resort hotel data comes from the Algarve region and the city hotel data comes from Lisbon, the capital city.  

The task is to use data in which the reservation date is between July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2017 to predict whether reservations for July 1, 2017 to August 31, 2017 will be cancelled.
